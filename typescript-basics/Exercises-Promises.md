# Promise Exercises

## Exercise 1: General Promises

Write a function testNum that takes a number as an argument and returns a Promise that tests if the value is less than or greater than the value 10.

## Exercise 2: Promise Chaining

Write two functions that use Promises that you can chain!
The first function, makeAllCaps(), will take in an array of words and capitalize them.
The second function, sortWords(), will sort the words in alphabetical order.
If the array contains anything but strings, it should throw an error.
